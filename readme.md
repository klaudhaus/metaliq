## Documentation

You can read the full documentation for the open-source MetaliQ platform at [https://metaliq.dev](https://metaliq.dev).

## The MetaliQ Platform

MetaliQ is a platform for delivering digital business solutions as policy-based, composable, runnable MetaModels.

The `metaliq` library and associated libraries in the `@metaliq` organisation provide a free, open-source framework for defining policy-based MetaModels using TypeScript. MetaModels extend a solution's underlying data model using terms that are provided by various policies. MetaliQ provides ready-made policies for data validation and visualisation, interactive forms and more, and can be extended through custom policies to support any type of solution.

## Quick Start

You can create a new MetaliQ solution with the command:

```sh
pnpm create @metaliq
```

Note that there are some subtle differences between NPM clients such as `npm`, `yarn ` and `pnpm` (our preferred option). We aim to confidently support them all going forward, but we are currently prioritising focus on MetaliQ platform features and capabilities, so we recommend using `pnpm` when working with MetaliQ.

The `create` command above will scaffold a new solution and launch a sample full-stack application that presents an interactive project configuration interface and showcases further platform features. This application along with its source code is accessible in the `src` folder and can be used as a guide to authoring front and back end MetaModels.

## Support

MetaliQ is published under a permissive open source license (MIT) and may be used for any purpose. Community input is welcome but this license provides no implied warranties or service level agreements for things such as feature requests or issue resolution.

If you have questions about how MetaliQ can support your organisation's solution requirements, feel free to contact us at [Klaudhaus](http://klaud.haus). We provide support, training, mentoring and consultancy services around applying MetaModel patterns and delivering MetaliQ platform solutions across a range of industries.
