## The MetaliQ Platform

The `metaliq` library and associated libraries in the `@metaliq` organisation provide a free, open-source framework for defining model-driven, policy-based specifications using TypeScript. It can be used independently to develop and build complete solutions. It is provided with ready-made policies for data validation and visualisation, interactive forms and more, and can be extended through custom policies to support any type of solution.

#### Support

MetaliQ is published under a permissive open source license (MIT) and may be used for any purpose. Community input is welcome but this license provides no implied warranties or service level agreements for things such as feature requests or issue resolution.

If you have questions about how MetaliQ can support your organisation's solution requirements, feel free to contact us at [Klaudhaus](http://klaudhaus.com). We provide training, mentoring and consultancy services around applying K-Factor strategies and delivering MetaliQ platform solutions across a range of industries.
