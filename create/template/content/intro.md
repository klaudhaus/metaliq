# New MetaliQ Solution

Welcome to MetaliQ!

You are now running a sample full-stack solution. The front-end displays the page you're reading as well as configuration options for `package.json` within your project. The back-end data service provides queries and mutations for the values in `package.json`.

This solution demonstrates various capabilities including:

* Mobile-friendly navigation using `@metaliq/navigation` and `@metaliq/navigator`
* Interactive forms with inline validation with `@metaliq/forms` and `@metaliq/validation`
* GraphQL API with `@metaliq/graphql-server`
* Content generated from Markdown using `@metaliq/metadoc`
