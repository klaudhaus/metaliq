# Metaliq Forms

The `@metaliq/forms` module provides various utilities and components for delivering online forms using the Lit based `@metaliq/presentation` policy.

It includes MetaViews for various typical form components such as text fields, checkboxes, buttons etc. It can be extended with more specific components including those in other `@metaliq` packages such as date pickers and selectors.

The provided components automatically link events to state management with `@metaliq/up`  as well as validation with inline field errors provided by `@metaliq/validation`.
